Pub Quiz Buddy

This app was made by myself and 3 other students at CodeClan on Week 9 of the course.  It displays all the pub quizzes in Edinburgh filterable by day.

The user is able to add a pub quiz should it not already be on the map, the form for this is below.

## How to setup Pub Quiz Buddy 

Pub Quiz buddy uses Google Apis so you will need to sign up to get a key. 

 - Create a Google developer account and sign up for an API key for both Google Maps and Google places.  For more info please visit https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key

- Git Clone this repo

- Create a file in your client directory called key.js

- In the file key.js please write this: key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE_PASTED_HERE"

- The hard part is now done!

- These following commands are all done using terminal.

- In both the server and client directory run 'npm install'

- In server directory run: 'npm run seeds'

- In server directory: 'npm run server:dev'

- Change to client directory: 'npm run serve'

- The App should now be loaded in localhost.
